'''
    The ship is departing from a recent stop at a space station 
    where you took on-board new supplies for the trip. 
    The captain has asked you to process all the goods 
    in the loading bay and ensure it has been properly logged 
    by the ship's master inventory system. 
    Fortunately all the goods have barcodes on them 
    that allow you to determine what they contain. 
    You quickly scan all the codes into your computer 
    (your input data). The scans provide three items of 
    information: 
    A unique item number, a quantity, and the category of the goods.
